# [Predicting 7-yr Prostate Cancer Survival with Machine Learning in R](https://github.com/robert-mdh-bui/ids506-healthcare-analytics/tree/main/prostate)

## Context: 
- This ML project and report is created as part of experiential learning at University of Illinois - Chicago, Liautaud Graduate Business School, course IDS.506 Healthcare Analytics.

## Problem:
- At diagnosis, healthcare providers need to gauge a patient's survivability to determine their needs for follow-up treatment timelines.

## Solution:
- Statistical machine learning methods combined with manual rule-based screens can provide a solid [33.6% predictive power uplift](https://github.com/robert-mdh-bui/ids506-healthcare-analytics/blob/e1f0fa5c47ab6204c570ebff89b35386151d1d90/prostate/ids.506%20-%20Applied%20Machine%20Learning_%20Detecting%207-year%20Prostate%20Cancer%20Survival.pdf) from null model.
- Model: [Gradient-boosted random forest ensemble (xGBoost) + manual screening rule.](https://github.com/robert-mdh-bui/ids506-healthcare-analytics/blob/main/prostate/modeling.Rmd)
